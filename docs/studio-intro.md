For.io Studio is a next-generation IDE that is specialized for rapid development of web backends. It runs (almost fully) in the browser and it can be used to develop Node.js backends on top of Express.js, using MongoDB. Other programming languages, frameworks and databases will be supported in future.

### Instant turnarounds

For.io Studio enables backend development in real time, with immediate turnarounds upon every change in the source code. To make this as smooth as possible, For.io Studio includes Express simulator and MongoDB simulator. This makes it possible to execute a large part of the backend (including database-aware end-to-end API tests) instantly in the browser, resulting in instant feedback about any change being made to the source code.

### MongoDB simulator

While the MongoDB simulator is very convenient for a quick & easy start and super-fast execution of the API tests, it only supports a subset of the MongoDB operations. Eventually, you will need to execute the API tests using real MongoDB database, typically running on your machine.
